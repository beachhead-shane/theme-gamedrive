              >BeachHead Labs is a newly-established game development studio
              located in the picturesque island country of Mauritius, just off

              We're passionately crafting new prototypes, drawing inspiration
              from the rich creative landscape of both the island and the
              broader Southern African region.

              Our gameplay loop immerses you in the struggles and rewards of
              both business management and ethical decision-making. Build
              relationships with key characters—from local government officials
              who hold sway over your land, to influential visitors like tech
              moguls who offer game-changing resources like satellite feeds.

              <b>Burning bridges with the authorities?</b> Brace yourself for a
              cutback in trade options.

              <b>Win the favor of influential guests?</b> Unlock a world of
              strategic possibilities, each choice spiraling out into myriad
              outcomes, making your story truly unique. Navigate intricate
              logistics like optimizing safari routes for customer satisfaction
              and budget concerns. Just don't think about introducing new
              species—that's highly illegal and will have serious repercussions
              for both you and the Kruger ecosystem. Feel the weight of every
              decision you make. With the wellbeing of of the park hanging in
              the balance, every choice you make echoes in the corridors of
              power and the heart of the wilderness. Will your story be one of
              ecological triumph?, or a calculated plan gone awry?

          <h2>Why this prototype should exist</h2>
          <p>
            <small>
              With a focus on relationship building and the moral dilemmas that
              unfold within your natural surroundings, we specifically want to
              prototype the interplay between the in-game moment to moment
              actions, and the emergent world events.

              <br />
              <br />
              This is to ensure we can make the player feel the weight of their
              decisions on the environment around them in surprising ways,
              leading to many hours of replayability
